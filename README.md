# Salvation
This package is based off of a few open-source tools that I have found very handy. This also has a copy of the sysinternals suite, and some process dumping and repair utilities.
The hash text file is not updated regularly
WARNING:
Do not use the repair file from source, please use the release. The source file is for testing only and does not fully function.
